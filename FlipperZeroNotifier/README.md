Considering the uprising demand for Flipper Zero, you might be experiencing some issues with purchasing this device. 
Moreover, you might not have enough time to check the website or discord if the shop had been restocked.

This script allows you to check if the Flipper Zero is available for purchase without making a move. Basically, 
you will receive quite a common notification on your computer. It will look like a usual message notification.

Libraries needed:
    <ol>
    <li> plyer </li>
    <li> pyobjus </li>
    <li> requests </li>
    </ol>

If you don't have these libraries installed, then run NecessaryLibrariesInstall.py script in the terminal similarly as you 
would do with the FlipperNotifier.py script. Then proceed to the next step.

Running instruction:
    MacOS:
         <ol>
         <li> Open Terminal </li>
         <li> Before running the script, you need to locate it: type `cd whatever-folder-it-is-in` </li>
         <li> Type `python3 FlipperNotifier.py` </li>
         </ol>
        If you want to stop the application, press <control + C> in the Terminal
